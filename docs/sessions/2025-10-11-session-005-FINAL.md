Session 005: Infrastructure as Code + CVE Automation - FINAL

Date: 2025-10-11
Status: ✅ Complete (CVE reporter code ready, deployment deferred to Session 006)
CI/CD Workflow: Established - All future work via Git → Pipeline
Email Alerts: damoke012@hotmail.com

Summary

Successfully transformed platform into production-grade Infrastructure as Code:
- ✅ Multi-cloud storage abstraction (Azure/AWS/GCP/OpenShift)
- ✅ CVE email automation code complete (Helm chart + Python scripts)
- ✅ Ansible playbooks for maintenance
- ✅ CI/CD-first approach established
- ⏭️ CVE reporter deployment → Session 006 (needs custom Docker image)

---
What Was Completed

1. Ansible Automation (3 playbooks)

- trivy-db-update.yml - Weekly Trivy database updates
- cve-reporter-deploy.yml - CVE reporter deployment
- harbor-backup.yml - Weekly Harbor backups
- Cron jobs configured: /etc/cron.weekly/

2. CVE Email Reporter (Code Complete)

Files Created:
- Helm chart structure: helm-charts/cve-reporter/
- webhook_receiver.py (83 lines) - Real-time CVE alerts
- weekly_report.py (104 lines) - Monday 8 AM summaries
- Kubernetes manifests: Deployment, Service, CronJob, ConfigMap

Why Not Deployed:
- Airgapped environment blocks pip install in init container
- Needs custom Docker image with dependencies pre-installed
- Action: Session 006 will build image and push to Harbor

3. Weekly Automation Configured

- Trivy DB update: /etc/cron.weekly/trivy-db-update
- Harbor backup: /etc/cron.weekly/harbor-backup

4. Documentation

- Session notes: docs/sessions/2025-10-11-session-005-FINAL.md
- Updated README with CI/CD workflow
- CVE reporter README with deployment instructions

CI/CD Workflow Established

From Session 005 forward: No manual changes!

Code → Git → Pipeline → Deploy

All infrastructure/platform changes through:
- Terraform (infrastructure provisioning)
- Ansible (configuration management)
- ArgoCD (application deployment)

NO MORE: kubectl apply, oc create, helm install, manual UI config

---
Session 005 Achievements

✅ Ansible installed with Kubernetes/OpenShift modules
✅ 3 automation playbooks created and tested
✅ Weekly cron jobs configured
✅ CVE reporter Helm chart complete (83 + 104 lines Python)
✅ Multi-cloud storage abstraction ready
✅ Git repository updated with all artifacts
✅ CI/CD workflow documented and enforced

Next: Session 006

Focus: Complete CVE Automation + CI/CD Pipeline

Tasks:
1. Build custom Docker image with Python dependencies
2. Push image to Harbor registry
3. Deploy CVE reporter using local image
4. Configure Harbor webhook
5. Test email notifications
6. Set up Tekton/Jenkins CI/CD pipeline

Estimated Progress: ~50% (Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 starting)
